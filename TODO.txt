All the recent development was for ecc 0 without fixation. The old code for brief presentation with fixation used to work, and could easily work again, but isn’t quite functional right now.

I’d like to add a new feature. When the shift key is held down, it should display a “response page” showing the whole alphabet, allowing the observer to get acquainted. This page won’t accept responses; it’s just for teaching. This is an alternative for the printed page. This may be better for PCA patients, allowing them to study the alphabet without taking their eyes off the screen.

Add checkbox to Viewing distance screen. “Using mirror.”
