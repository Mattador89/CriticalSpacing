move obsolete run* scripts into "Old Scripts"

cosmetic bugs: (runVisualAcuity:) when useFractionOfScreen the eccentricity is forced to zero, and there is no blanking of fixation at target location. and the reported screen subtense should be full, but is partial.

NO (there will generally be lots of patient data, and itâ€™s not reasonable to type it in for each run. we need to link the two data sets by the observer name.): collect observer age before experiment (this information is useful to save in the data files)
