## How to use CriticalSpacing to measure an observer's critical spacing and acuity for single and repeated targets.

"CriticalSpacing.m" is a MATLAB program developed by Denis Pelli at NYU, with help from Hörmet Yiltiz. You can read more about this program and its purpose in our
2016 article:

Pelli, D. G., Waugh, S. J., Martelli, M., Crutch, S. J., Primativo, S., Yong, K. X., Rhodes, M., Yee, K., Wu, X., Famira, H. F., & Yiltiz, H.

To install and run CriticalSpacing on your machine, please do the following:

1. CLICK the "Download ZIP" button above (on right side) or this link to download the CriticalSpacing software:
[https://github.com/denispelli/CriticalSpacing/archive/v0.3.zip](https://github.com/denispelli/CriticalSpacing/archive/v0.3.zip)
1. UNPACK the “zip” archive, producing a folder called CriticalSpacing.
1. INSTALL SOFTWARE. Inside the CriticalSpacing folder, open the Word document, "Install CriticalSpacing.docx" for detailed instructions for installation of MATLAB and CriticalSpacing.
1. TYPE "help CriticalSpacing" in the MATLAB Command Window. 

## Software requirements:

CriticalSpacing, Psychtoolbox, and MATLAB

## Hardware requirements:

A laptop running Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux, with the above software installed. 
(Or a digital screen driven by a computer with such software. We need the digital screen in order for the computer to tell CriticalSpacing.m the screen size and resolution.)
A remote keyboard: wireless or with a 10-m-long cable.
A 10 m measuring tape (or laser) to measure the viewing distance.
A printed copy of the relevant alphabet page selected from the CriticalSpacing/pdf/ folder.
